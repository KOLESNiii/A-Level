By Tim K.

-The safe has a 6 separate combination codes - each code is in the range 1 to 20 inclusive and is randomly generated for each game.
-The player has 10 attempts in total to guess the 6 codes.
-On each turn, the program must output the status of each combination code (whether it has been discovered or not) and the number of guesses remaining to the player. 
-If a code has been guessed, this must be indicated to the user. 
-The program must then ask the player to enter a number to guess a code. 
-Validation must prevent the player from entering a number outside of the range 1-20
-"                                " from trying the same code more than once.
